# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?
JSX is essentially a hybrib between javascript and HTML. With that said there are elements of both within JSX. The syntax difference between would be that, inorder to reference javascript in the HTML section, you wrap a variable in curly braces. 
Your answer:  ⤴

Researched answer:⤵
JSX is essentially a syntactic sugar for JavaScript. 
Also another difference is ids within fragments, as it pertains to css are labled with " className = " "

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified when you run the command yarn in your terminal?
yarn is a mackage manager. When yarn is run through the terminal code is added to the files to assist the engineer with development. I believe the files that are modified would be the index.html, the style.css , and the app.js
Your answer: ⤴

Researched answer: ⤵
Yarn is a tool for managing dependencies in JavaScript projects. When you run the yarn command, it reads the package.json file to figure out what dependencies to install. It then modifies the yarn.lock file to record the exact versions of those dependencies, updates the package.json file if necessary, and installs the dependencies into a node_modules directory in your project.


3. What is a React component?
React components are components of React.. Duhhh :P  
These components are dynamic and reusable bits of code. 

Your answer: ⤴

Researched answer: ⤵
In React, a component is a reusable piece of code that represents a part of a user interface. It can take in props and return a React element. Components are the building blocks of React applications, can be nested to create complex UI, and can be created as functional or class components. They can be used on both the client and server-side to create isomorphic or universal applications.

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?
Im not entirly sure, I know state is referencing a useState which is defined above the return and referenced back within code on the same page. The thing is you need to import at the top of the file: "import React, {useState} "react". Where as props are more a conversation between a parent and child file. Props are referenced in the child component using parenthesis and .Notation, an example would be: (props.key.value); this allows the child to reference the parent. 
Your answer: ⤴

Researched answer: ⤵
Props and state are used to manage data in React components. Props are read-only and are passed down from parent components to configure and customize child components. State is managed within a component and is mutable, allowing a component to change its own data and trigger a re-render when it does.

5. What is the DOM?
DOM is a tree... stands for document object model. 
Your answer: ⤴

Researched answer: ⤵
The DOM is a way for web developers to interact with and manipulate the contents of a web page using code. It represents the content of a web page as a hierarchical tree-like structure of objects that can be accessed, modified, and deleted dynamically in response to user actions or other events. It is supported by all modern web browsers and is used extensively in client-side scripting languages like JavaScript.

4. Ruby blocks:

5. Ruby hashes:


## ############ ANSWERS TO STRETCH ⤵

1. Object-oriented programming is like playing with Legos. Just like how you can build different structures using different Lego pieces, you can create different objects in programming using different classes. These objects can have properties (like color, size, etc.) and behaviors (like moving, speaking, etc.). It's a way of organizing and structuring code to make it easier to work with.

2. Ruby is a programming language that people use to build websites, games, and other software. It's kind of like a toolbox that programmers can use to create things.

3. Implicit return is like when you borrow something from a friend and give it back without saying anything. In programming, it's like when a function automatically gives you back a value without you having to write a return statement.

4. Ruby blocks are like giving someone instructions on how to do something step-by-step. In programming, a block is a set of code that you can pass to a function to tell it what to do. It's a way to customize how a function works.

5. Ruby hashes are like a dictionary where you can look up words and find their definitions. In programming, a hash is a way to store data in pairs of keys and values. It's a way to organize and retrieve data based on specific keys.
